# Lessons Learned

Read this file before implementation and again before final review. Record only verified,
recurring traps that are not already obvious from code, tests, or canonical documentation.
Update an existing lesson instead of adding a duplicate.

## Keep desktop engine features at the presentation boundary

- Context: The initial root package depended on Bevy 0.19 with all default features.
- Symptom: `cargo clippy` on a headless Linux/WSL2 environment failed while building
  `wayland-sys` because the `wayland-client` system package was unavailable.
- Cause: Bevy's default platform features pulled windowing, Wayland, X11, input, and audio
  dependencies into every repository check before any project code was analyzed.
- Resolution: Move Bevy into `dreadstep-bevy`, disable default features, and enable only
  `std` until a presentation milestone needs a reviewed feature set. A representative
  Bevy 0.19 package with this configuration passed Clippy on the same environment.
- Prevention: Keep engine dependencies out of core, protocol, and content; inspect enabled
  features before adding presentation capabilities; verify the headless Linux workflow.

## Enable Bevy input modules explicitly when default features are disabled

- Context: The first human-client bridge needs keyboard `KeyCode` values while the workspace keeps
  Bevy desktop backends disabled for headless verification.
- Symptom: With `default-features = false` and only `std`, the Bevy input module's keyboard types
  are not available to the presentation adapter.
- Cause: Bevy gates keyboard support behind its optional `keyboard` feature; `std` does not enable
  optional input modules.
- Resolution: Enable Bevy's `keyboard` feature alongside the existing `std` feature in the
  workspace dependency. The bridge then compiles and tests without enabling `default_platform`,
  Wayland, X11, audio, or window backends.
- Prevention: Add the narrowest Bevy feature required by a presentation slice, inspect
  `cargo tree -e features`, and keep `scripts/check-repository.sh` guarding desktop features.
